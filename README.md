# Walking-Piano - A Soundbendor Lab Project

## Project Goal:
The Walking Piano project allows users to play various songs on piano with a catch: the user must play with their feet.  Our aim was to develop a standalone software that works alongside a physical MIDI piano controller that can be played by the user as they move across the physical piano and playing space. By providing simple guidance with colored notes falling towards a visual piano for reference, the software will empower users of all skill levels to enjoy the unique experience of playing a large-scale piano and creating music, alone, or with a friend. 


The project utilizes the programming language Python, and specifically takes advantage of two powerful libraries: Pyglet (for visuals) and Mido (for easy reading and manipulating the MIDI music files). Putting these together, we produced software that is exciting, intuitive, and contributes to the creation of beautiful music.
